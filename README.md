# Fuzzy-Logic-Pong
Let's get Fuzzy ðŸ¤ª !!!

Using Phaser, create a HTML5 project that is a a Multiplayer (Client/Server) clone of the classic Pong game



**This Pong game has the following features:**

- the classic Pong game mechanics

- a server application that allows two human clients to connect

- once one client connects, the server randomly assigns

- 1. an traditional AI bot 
  2. an AI bot using fuzzy logic or 
  3. one of the available human opponents 

- after each game session is finished, the human player is asked if the opponent was an AI bot or a human and the answer as well as the actual setup are saved to a JSON file by the server

- Allow for teams of two to play one-another, whereby it is possible to have AI/AI, AI/Human and Human/Human teams. (Bonus)
